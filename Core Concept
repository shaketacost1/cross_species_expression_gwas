Biological Scope

Core Concept:
You are investigating enhancer gain/loss across human, macaque, mouse, and pig (with chicken available as an outgroup), with CTCF binding as a regulatory context. Human is the reference species.
Hypotheses to test:
Conserved enhancers → higher, stable expression across species.
Lost enhancers → reduced expression in humans.
Gained enhancers → human-specific expression.
CTCF proximity → may explain which enhancer changes are functionally constrained.
GWAS SNP overlap → gained/lost enhancers might harbor trait/disease variants.

Phenotypes of interest:
Alcohol use (strongest cross-species signals).
BMI (morphological variation).
Inflammation (expected conserved signals).

2. Analytical Scope
Enhancer Mapping & Classification:
Align enhancer coordinates across species.
Classify as conserved, gained, or lost relative to human.
Gene Expression Analysis:
Use Bgee TPM data (already processed).
Test whether expression correlates with enhancer conservation.

CTCF Binding:
Overlay binding sites to test whether gained/lost enhancers cluster near CTCF boundaries.

GWAS SNPs:
Use NHGRI-EBI Catalog (already subset for alcohol, BMI, inflammation).
Run enrichment tests to compare SNP density across conserved vs. gained/lost enhancers.

Stretch Goals:
Motif analysis of gained enhancers (species-specific signatures).
Heritability partitioning using GWAS summary stats.

3. Computational / Software Scope

Backend & Data Handling:

Datasets: enhancers, CTCF, expression (Bgee), GWAS SNPs.
Storage: DuckDB + Parquet for efficiency.
API endpoints to query enhancers by species/gene/coordinates.

Visualization & Frontend:
Genome-browser inspired view (coordinates on x-axis, layers for enhancers, genes, CTCF, SNPs).
Searchable by gene name or coordinates.
Static plots first → interactive interface later.
Export option for downstream use.

Frameworks:
BadTools / Pi.BadTools for coordinate overlaps.
Python backend (FastAPI) + web front end (Dash/Streamlit) as primary stack.

4. Project Management
Phased Plan (already scaffolded):

Phase 1–3: Data collection, enhancer mapping/classification (done: gene expression + GWAS prep; pending: enhancer + CTCF).

Phase 4: Functional analyses (expression vs. enhancer conservation, CTCF overlap, SNP enrichment).

Phase 5–6: Backend + visualization.


Phase 7: Case studies (alcohol-related genes, inflammatory pathways, BMI).

Phase 8: Final integration & presentation.

Logistics:
Weekly Tuesday 12:30 meetings + 3x/week check-ins.
Rotating leadership for accountability.
Repo, Trello, Slack/Teams, Gantt already set up.

Critical Species/Datasets:
Human (reference), macaque, mouse, pig (priority), chicken (optional outgroup).

Expression: Bgee.

Enhancers: Villar (2015), ENCODE, VISTA, PHANTOM.

CTCF: ENCODE ChIP-seq.

GWAS: NHGRI-EBI (alcohol, BMI, inflammation).
