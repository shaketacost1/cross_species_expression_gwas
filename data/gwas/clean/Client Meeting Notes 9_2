Core Biological Concept
    •    Study how enhancer gain, loss, and conservation across species (human, macaque, mouse, pig) relate to gene expression patterns.
    •    Hypothesis:
    ◦    Conserved enhancers → higher expression, universal traits.
    ◦    Lost enhancers → lower expression in humans compared to other species.
    ◦    Gained enhancers → human-specific expression patterns.
    •    Gene expression levels are usually conserved across species, but enhancer sequences differ, reflecting evolutionary changes in regulation.

Analytical Approach
    1    Enhancer Categories
    ◦    Conserved, gained, or lost relative to a focal gene.
    ◦    Examine enhancer landscapes within a gene-centered window.
    2    Comparative Questions
    ◦    Do genes with more conserved enhancers have higher expression?
    ◦    Do human-specific genes show more enhancer gains?
    ◦    Do enhancer losses correlate with reduced expression?
    3    Sequence-Level Analysis
    ◦    Analyze human-gained enhancers for unique transcription factor motifs.
    ◦    Expect distinct species-specific regulatory signatures.
    4    Extended Angles
    ◦    CTCF binding site analysis: adds another evolutionary perspective.
    ◦    Start with disease-associated genes as an accessible entry point.
    ◦    Stretch goal: incorporate GWAS variants into enhancer landscapes to see how genetic variation relates to gene expression.
    ◦    Statistical models: enrichment tests, heritability analyses, and integration with visualization layers.

Phenotypes of Interest
    •    Alcohol use → strongest signal in humans.
    •    BMI → broad, but varies with species-specific morphology.
    •    Inflammation → universal, expected in conserved enhancers.

Data Sources
    •    ENCODE (CTCF and enhancer datasets).
    •    ChIP, PHANTOM, VISTA (enhancer annotations).
    •    Additional datasets may be needed for pig and other non-model organisms.
    •    Linked papers provide raw enhancer/expression data even if web portals are down.

Computational Tools & File Handling
    •    Wide coordinate files handled with:
    ◦    BadTools / Pi. BadTools → pandas-like interface for overlaps, agreements, disagreements.
    ◦    Useful for both command-line workflows and web application integration.
    •    Galaxy may support some tasks, but command-line + Pi. BadTools is recommended.

CS-Side Visualization & Application Design
    •    Search Features:
    ◦    By species selection.
    ◦    By coordinates (chromosome, start, end).
    ◦    By gene name.
    •    Genome Browser-Like Layout:
    ◦    X-axis = chromosome coordinates.
    ◦    Boxes for genes and enhancers.
    ◦    Layered species views; ability to scroll/zoom.
    •    Development Strategy:
    ◦    Early sprints: static cached visualizations.
    ◦    Later sprints: dynamic interactive browser.
    ◦    Potential to add data layers (enhancer conservation, CTCF, GWAS variants, enrichment results).

Enhancer Genie (Previous Capstone Tool)
    •    Built by Baylor’s prior capstone class.
    •    Features:
    ◦    Upload enhancers → choose genome version, tissue, algorithm.
    ◦    Outputs gene–enhancer connections.
    ◦    Interaction checker (validates enhancer–gene associations).
    •    Access limited to Baylor firewall; works in lab.
    •    Provides a useful framework for search, visualization, and data upload/download.

Highlighted Major Points
    •    Enhancer conservation vs. gain/loss underpins species differences in expression.
    •    CTCF binding sites + disease gene analysis extend the evolutionary and functional scope.
    •    Stretch goal: GWAS integration ties enhancer landscapes to human variation and complex traits.
    •    Statistical enrichment and heritability models add analytical depth.
    •    Alcohol, BMI, inflammation provide diverse test cases for conserved vs. human-specific signals.
    •    BadTools / Pi. BadTools essential for processing coordinate files.
    •    Genome-browser inspired visualization with layered species and coordinate-based search is a central design goal.
    •    Enhancer Genie demonstrates a successful prior model to build upon.
    •    Open-ended project design allows natural evolution toward more advanced analyses
