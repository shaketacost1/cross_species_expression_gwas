Evolutionary Dynamics of Regulatory Element Landscapes

Background
Enhancers are regulatory DNA sequences that control when and how genes are expressed (i.e., transcribed) in
different cells. Across species, some enhancers are deeply conserved, while others are gained or lost during
evolution. These changes can rewire gene regulation, influence expression patterns, and contribute to differences
in disease susceptibility. CTCF, a key architectural protein, helps shape 3D genome organization, and its binding
sites often create regulatory domains.
In this project, you will explore how enhancer gain and loss relates to gene expression, CTCF binding, and
heritability of complex traits (such as addiction and stress).

Goal & Research Questions
Your goal is to design and build a system that integrates cross-species enhancer data, gene expression, CTCF
binding, and GWAS results to uncover how regulatory element evolution influences disease biology.
1. 2. 3. 4. Which enhancers are conserved, gained, or lost across species?
How do enhancer gains/losses relate to changes in gene expression?
Are gained or lost enhancers enriched near CTCF binding sites?
Are complex trait–associated SNPs enriched in gained/lost enhancers compared to conserved ones?
General Tasks
An outline of broad tasks:
- Collect and organize enhancer, CTCF, gene expression, and GWAS data across species.
- Map enhancers across species and classify them as conserved, gained, or lost.
- Explore how enhancer changes relate to gene expression and CTCF binding.
- Analyze whether gained or lost enhancers overlap trait-associated SNPs.
- Create a database and backend API to allow dynamic access to genes, enhancers, and metadata.
- Design interactive visualizations to show enhancer conservation, gain/loss patterns, expression changes,
and trait associations.
- Integrate your analyses, backend, and visualizations into a functioning web app or Python-based interface.
- Highlight a few key genes as case studies showing enhancer evolution and functional impact.
Deliverables
By the end of the semester, your team will deliver a working software system (web app or Python package with a
lightweight app interface) that:
- Explores genes of interest and view their enhancer landscapes.
- Visualizes enhancer gains/losses alongside CTCF binding and expression differences.
- Highlights whether GWAS SNPs overlap conserved or species-specific enhancers.
- Provides downloadable results for downstream use.
